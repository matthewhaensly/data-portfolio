- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **SciPy** - Statistical testing
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Development environment

## üìä Dataset Details

**Simulated Dataset Features:**
- **5,000 orders** spanning 18 months (Jan 2023 - Jun 2024)
- **5 product categories**: Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden, Books, Sports

- `customer_id` - Customer identifier (some customers have multiple orders)
- `order_date` - Date of purchase
- `category` - Product category
- `region` - Geographic region
- `customer_segment` - Customer classification
- `unit_price` - Price per item
- `quantity` - Number of items ordered
- `total_amount` - Total order value

## üîç Analysis Highlights

### Revenue Performance
- **Total Revenue**: $1.87M across 5,000 orders
- **Average Order Value**: $374.35
- **Peak Month**: December 2023 with holiday season boost

### Category Insights
- **Electronics** leads in total revenue despite higher price points
- **Clothing** has highest order volume due to accessibility
- Clear price differentiation across categories

### Geographic Analysis
- **North America** dominates with 40% market share
